                <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Spaghetti</li>
                        <li>Tomato puree</li>
                        <li>Tomato sauce (prego is my fav)</li>
                        <li>Basil</li>
                        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
                        <li>Salt and pepper for taste</li>
                        <li>Chicken or beef</li>
                    </ul>


                <h3>Steps</h3>
                
                    <ol>
                        <li>Boil your instant spaghetti in a bowl. Add some salt to flavor it. Make sure it is ala dante (I think it means medium-hard)</li>
                        <li>Now, while your spaghetti is boiling, cook your minced meat in a pan until it is edible and add your tomato paste followed by the tomato sauce. Leave it to a boil. You can add more salt to taste. Moreover, you can add herbs to make it taste even awesome!</li>
                        <li>Once your spaghetti has been cooked, get rid of the water. Use a strainer and pour the unwanted water in your sink. Be sure not to burn yourself during the process.</li>
                        <li>Now the best part, once everything is ready, it's time to plate it! Find the most cool plate that you have and put the spaghetti first. Then, add the tomato sauce. If you have some cheese laying around, grate it on top for maximum flavor.</li>

                    </ol>
